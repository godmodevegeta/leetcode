# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree  

![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)  

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Given a binary tree `root`, a node `X` in the tree is named **good** if, in the path from the root to `X`, there are no nodes with a value **greater than** `X`.  

Return the number of **good nodes** in the binary tree.

## 🔹 Constraints  

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range **[1, 10⁵]**.  
- Each node's value is between **[-10⁴, 10⁴]**.

## 🖥️ Solution  

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        def dfs(node, curMax):
            if not node:
                return
            if node.val >= curMax:
                count[0] += 1
                curMax = node.val
            dfs(node.left, curMax)
            dfs(node.right, curMax)
        
        count = [0]
        dfs(root, root.val)
        
        return count[0]
                
```
